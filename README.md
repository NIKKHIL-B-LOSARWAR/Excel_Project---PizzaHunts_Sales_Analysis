## Project Theme:
Pizza Hunts is a renowned food outlet in the town, known for its wide range of pizzas and 12-year dominance in the market. However, due to increasing competition in recent years, their market share has declined. To regain their competitive edge, they seek the expertise of a data analyst to provide a comprehensive sales analysis report based on their 2015 data. The objective is to develop a report that addresses specific business challenges and provides actionable insights into sales performance and customer behavior. The resulting analysis will enable Pizza Hunts to make informed decisions and implement effective strategies to improve their market position.

## Tools Implemented:

* Microsoft Excel.
* Microsoft SQL Server and Management Studio.
* Power Query.

## Development Approach:

The project development approach involves six key steps, starting with understanding the source data and analytical goals, which serve as the basis for the subsequent steps. Data cleaning is imperative to ensure consistency and reliability, followed by data processing, where new columns are derived to facilitate analysis. Data analysis is the focal point, using appropriate visualization charts to address each business problem. The visualization elements are then integrated into a dashboard. Lastly, data and analysis are validated through SQL queries to ensure accuracy and reliability, culminating in an analysis validation report.

The Project Development comprises following key steps-
1. Understanding Source data and analytical goals.
2. Transforming and Shaping source data (Data Cleaning) .
3. Data processing.
4. Data Analysis.
5. Data Visualization OR Dashboarding.
6. Analysis Validation.
7. Extract key Insights.
